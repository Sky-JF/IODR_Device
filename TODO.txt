- Map out which pins connect to which components (done)
- Determine why analogRead is being redirected from A8 to all other pins (A9, A10, A11) (done, this is due to PureAnalogPin being interpreted incorrectly by mbed os)
- Test connecting wires between analogue pins (done, works)
- Test voltage divider to determine if analogue pins are reading correctly (done, connected properly)
- Advanced analogue library? (no need atm)
to fix issues with the analog read, either all pins will need to be hardcoded outside an array, or the correct object type for these analog pin constants will need to be found
- Integrate Thingspeak (done, used get request to send data)

Ongoing:
- Test Simple.ino and oneWireSearch.ino for the temperature sensor
- Create a channel for documenting error codes. Then, use this reference to diagnose the
upload error
  https://www.mathworks.com/help/thingspeak/error-codes.html
- Thingspeak upload error (code -4). Either the httpClient can't parse the http request
the thingspeak API returned, or the API is returning a nonesense request.  


Later:
- Make a unit test for major functions
- Integrate InfluxDB
- Integrate Flash memory/EEPROM
- Integrate watchdog timer (reset if wifi is unable to connect after some time)
