- Map out which pins connect to which components (done)
- Determine why analogRead is being redirected from A8 to all other pins (A9, A10, A11) (done, this is due to PureAnalogPin being interpreted incorrectly by mbed os)
- Test connecting wires between analogue pins (done, works)
- Test voltage divider to determine if analogue pins are reading correctly (done, connected properly)
- Advanced analogue library? (no need atm)
to fix issues with the analog read, either all pins will need to be hardcoded outside an array, or the correct object type for these analog pin constants will need to be found
- Integrate Thingspeak (done, used get request to send data)
- Fix temperature sensor readings

-Things to try
    - Increase timeouts: httpClient.setHttpResponseTimeout(10000);  // default is ~5000 ms
(did not work)

    - Close previous connection before new upload
        httpClient.stop();
        delay(50);
              - Seems like the wifi socket being used by the http connection was being
overused over time. To mitigate this, the socket connection is closed and opened again.  

    - Malformed HTTP header: try printing raw response

    - Email thingspeak asking about server overload error message

    - Improved requests by sending each request through different socket connections

Ongoing:
  - Out-of-memory crashes may occur because of string concatenation use instead of
snprintf()
  - Implement over-the-air uploads



Later:
- Make a unit test for major functions
- Integrate InfluxDB
