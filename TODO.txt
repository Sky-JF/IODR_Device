- Determine why analogRead is being redirected from A8 to all other pins (A9, A10, A11)
- Test connecting wires between analogue pins
- Test voltage divider to determine if analogue pins are reading correctly -> use
potentiometer to test voltage read by each pin
- Adjust resolution of analogue reads
- Advanced analogue library?


Later:
- Integrate Thingspeak
- Integrate InfluxDB
- Integrate Flash memory/EEPROM
